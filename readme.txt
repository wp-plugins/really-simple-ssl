No setup required! You only need an SSL certificate, and this plugin will do the rest.

== Description ==
The really simple ssl plugin detects ssl by trying to open a page through https.
If ssl is detected it will configure your site to support ssl.

= Two simple steps for setup: =
* Get an SSL certificate from your hosting provider (can't do that for you, sorry).
* Activate this plugin.

= What does the plugin actually do =
* The plugin handles most issues that Wordpress has with ssl, like the much discussed loadbalancer issue, or when there are no server variables set at all.
* All incoming requests are redirected to https. If possible with .htaccess, or else with javascript.
* The site url and home url are changed to https.
* Your insecure content is fixed by replacing all included resources with https. Dynamically, so no database changes are made (except for the siteurl and homeurl).

= Feedback is welcome! =
Though the plugin is extensively tested and currently successfully active on over 5000 websites, it is impossible to test or even conceive of every different server configuration. So it might be possible you have issues with a non-standard server configuration.
Rather than ranting about it, I would appreciate it if you contact me with the issue, so I can help you fix it and improve the plugin at the same time.
I will need the following information:

* Debug report: activate debug and copy the results
* Domain
* Plugin list

[contact](http://www.really-simple-ssl.com/contact/) me if you have any questions or suggestions.

= Betatesting =
If you like to betatest, that would be great! Please enter my betatest mailinglist [here](http://www.really-simple-ssl.com/betatesting/).

= I need help translating =
I'd like to include more translations, if you'd like to help out, please contact me.

= Translation credits =
Thanks for the French translation to [Cédric](http://www.blig.fr/)
Thanks for the Russian translation to [xsacha](https://news36.org/)

= Under development, expected early 2016 =
* A check for possible external resources that are not available over ssl.
* Option to disable javascript redirect in settings.

== Installation ==
To install this plugin:

1. Install your ssl certificate
2. Download the plugin
3. Upload the plugin to the wp-content/plugins directory,
4. Go to “plugins” in your wordpress admin, then click activate.
5. You will get redirected to the login screen. If not, go to the login screen and log on.

= Testing =
This plugin is tested in standard apache environments, but is built with several fallbacks for situations where non-standard configurations are used.
If you have issues, please contact me. Maybe we can fix your configuration as well.

= Uninstalling =
In some cases it happens that you cannot access your admin anymore, which would prevent your from uninstalling. The
plugin is shipped with a simple method to uninstall:

1. In the wp-content/plugins/really-simple-ssl folder, rename the file "force-deactivate.txt" to "force-deactivate.php".
2. In your browser, go to www.yourdomain.com/wp-content/plugins/really-simple-ssl/force-deactivate.php

The plugin is now deactivated and all changes were removed.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Troubleshooting shortlist =
You can find the cause of most issues when looking in the Chrome console:
In Chrome, right click on your webpage, then select "inspect element" to see what links are causing this (you can ignore hyperlinks).

* If you are experiencing redirects on your site, you might want to try disabling the .htaccess:
Add to your wp-config.php:
define( 'RLRSSSL_DO_NOT_EDIT_HTACCESS', TRUE);
* If parts of your site aren't loading, you might have external resources that are not able to load on ssl. Check the Google console.
* If your browser still gives mixed content warnings:

1. Clear the cache of your browser and of your Wordpress site, if you use a caching plugin.
2. Check the Google console for errors. If you have non https links to your own site, or "src='http://" in the source of your website,
the insecure content fixer is probably blocked by another plugin. You can check this by deactivating your plugins one by one, and see if really simple ssl starts working.
Let me know if you find a plugin conflict, so I can put it in my conflict list.

= How to uninstall when website/backend is not accessible =
Though this plugin is extensively tested, this can still happen. However, this is very easy to fix (you'll need ftp access):

1. In the wp-content/plugins/really-simple-ssl folder, rename the file "force-deactivate.txt" to "force-deactivate.php".
2. In your browser, go to www.yourdomain.com/wp-content/plugins/really-simple-ssl/force-deactivate.php

The plugin is now deactivated and all changes were removed.

= What does the option "HSTS" mean? =
HSTS means HTTP Strict Transport Security, and makes browsers force your visitors over https.
As this setting will be remembered by your visitor's browsers for at least a year, you should only enable this when your setup is up and running, and you do not plan
to revert back to http.

= My hits in Google Analytics have dropped. What happened? =
After you move to SSL, you should change your domain in Google Analytics as well. In Google Search Console, you should add the https variant.
If the redirect wasn't set in your .htaccess for some reason, try to add it manually. I've had feedback that GA does not register hits when the redirect was not in place.

= The settings page says redirect could not be set in the .htaccess. Is that a problem? =
Not really. The plugin also adds some javascript to redirect any non https pages, so your site should load over https without any problems.
Furthermore, you can enable the HSTS setting to improve security.

Common causes:
1. The .htaccess is not writable, or not available. To fix it, make writable, or enter the rewriterules manually
2. Testing of the .htaccess rewrite rules failed, due to missing server variables or not being able to reach the testing page. These issues are caused by your server configuration, contact your hosting provider

= Is it possible to exclude certain urls from the ssl redirect? =
That is not possible. This plugin simply forces your complete site over https, which keeps it lightweight.

= Is the plugin suitable for wordpress multisite? =
Yes, the plugin is wpmu ready.
You can activate ssl per site on subdomain installs, but not on subfolder installs (domain.com/site1).

= Does the plugin do a seo friendly 301 redirect in the .htaccess? =
Yes, default the plugin redirects permanently with [R=301].

== Upgrade notice ==
Always back up before any upgrade. Especially .htaccess, wp-config.php and the plugin folder. This way you can easily roll back.
In general I would always recommend a solid backup policy, as that will prevent a lot of stress, yelling, and hitting yourself.

== Screenshots ==
1. After activation, your ssl will be detected if present
2. View your configuration on the settings page
3. Check if your site has mixed content. If you want you can just leave it that way, because of the built in mixed content fixer.
