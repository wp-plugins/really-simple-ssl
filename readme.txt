The really simple ssl plugin forces your complete site to go over https.
== Description ==
The really simple ssl plugin forces your complete site to go over https. Sometimes, hyperlinks referring to http are written in your posts or pages. That’s why this scripts also replaces every url that matches your site url in your site to https.

You could also use a plugin like Wordpress Https, which gives you more options. But if you don’t need those options it is a waist of resources to use a heavyweight plugin like that.
