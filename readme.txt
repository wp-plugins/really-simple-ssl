The really simple ssl plugin forces your complete site to go over https.
== Description ==
The really simple ssl plugin forces your complete site to go over https. Sometimes, hyperlinks referring to http are written in your posts or pages. That’s why this scripts also replaces every url that matches your site url in your site to https.

You could also use a plugin like Wordpress Https, which gives you more options. But if you don’t need those options it is a waist of resources to use a heavyweight plugin like that.

== Installation ==
To install this plugin:  

1. Download the plugin
2. Upload the plugin to the wp-content/plugins directory,
3. Go to “plugins” in your wordpress admin, then click activate.

The plugin is up and running, but you’re not quite there yet: you need to do some more stuff to go on https: 
4. If you haven’t done so already, install your ssl certificate.
5. Go settings/general, and change your wordpress url and site url to https. 

For the Wordpress backend I would recommend to use iThemes security, and change the settings to “force ssl for dashboard”, and “”force ssl for login”.
